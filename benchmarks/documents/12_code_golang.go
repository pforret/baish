	// Header returns the header map that will be sent by

	//
	// Changing the header map after a call to [ResponseWriter.WriteHeader] (or
	// [ResponseWriter.Write]) has no effect unless the HTTP status code was of the
	// 1xx class or the modified headers are trailers.
	//
	// There are two ways to set Trailers. The preferred way is to
	// predeclare in the headers which trailers you will later
	// send by setting the "Trailer" header to the names of the
	// trailer keys which will come later. In this case, those
	// keys of the Header map are treated as if they were
	// trailers. See the example. The second way, for trailer
	// keys not known to the [Handler] until after the first [ResponseWriter.Write],
	// is to prefix the [Header] map keys with the [TrailerPrefix]
	// constant value.
	//
	// To suppress automatic response headers (such as "Date"), set
	// their value to nil.
	Header() Header

	// Write writes the data to the connection as part of an HTTP reply.
	//
	// If [ResponseWriter.WriteHeader] has not yet been called, Write calls
	// WriteHeader(http.StatusOK) before writing the data. If the Header
	// does not contain a Content-Type line, Write adds a Content-Type set
	// to the result of passing the initial 512 bytes of written data to
	// [DetectContentType]. Additionally, if the total size of all written
	// data is under a few KB and there are no Flush calls, the
	// Content-Length header is added automatically.
	//
	// Depending on the HTTP protocol version and the client, calling
	// Write or WriteHeader may prevent future reads on the
	// Request.Body. For HTTP/1.x requests, handlers should read any
	// needed request body data before writing the response. Once the
	// headers have been flushed (due to either an explicit Flusher.Flush
	// call or writing enough data to trigger a flush), the request body
	// may be unavailable. For HTTP/2 requests, the Go HTTP server permits
	// handlers to continue to read the request body while concurrently
	// writing the response. However, such behavior may not be supported
	// by all HTTP/2 clients. Handlers should read before writing if
	// possible to maximize compatibility.
	Write([]byte) (int, error)

	// WriteHeader sends an HTTP response header with the provided
	// status code.
	//
	// If WriteHeader is not called explicitly, the first call to Write
	// will trigger an implicit WriteHeader(http.StatusOK).
	// Thus explicit calls to WriteHeader are mainly used to
	// send error codes or 1xx informational responses.
	//
	// The provided code must be a valid HTTP 1xx-5xx status code.
	// Any number of 1xx headers may be written, followed by at most
	// one 2xx-5xx header. 1xx headers are sent immediately, but 2xx-5xx
	// headers may be buffered. Use the Flusher interface to send
	// buffered data. The header map is cleared when 2xx-5xx headers are
	// sent, but not with 1xx headers.
	//
	// The server will automatically send a 100 (Continue) header
	// on the first read from the request body if the request has
	// an "Expect: 100-continue" header.
